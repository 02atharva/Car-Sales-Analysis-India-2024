#### 🧩 Project Structure -



##### The project is divided into four logical layers:

1. Excel – Raw dataset \& initial inspection
2. SQL – Business-focused querying and KPI analysis
3. Python – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) \& validation
4. Power BI – Interactive dashboard \& insights delivery



#### 📂 Dataset Description -



##### The dataset contains monthly car sales information across multiple dimensions:

###### Key Columns:

* Make (Brand)
* Model
* Month
* Quarter
* Sales
* Total Sales
* Segment
* Body Type
* MoM % (Month-on-Month Growth)
* YoY % (Year-on-Year Growth)



The data represents a denormalized reporting-style dataset, similar to what analysts encounter in real business environments.
